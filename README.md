# Association-Rule-Learning---Armut-

## Business Problem 

Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service. It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, modification, and transportation with a few touches on your computer or smartphone. It is desired to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning using the data set containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.

## Story of Dataset

The data set consists of the services customers receive and the categories of these services. It contains the date and time information of each service received.

UserId: Customer number
ServiceId: Anonymized services belonging to each category. (Example: Upholstery washing service under the cleaning category)
A service can be found under different categories and refers to different services under different categories.
(Example: The service with CategoryId 7 and ServiceId 4 is honeycomb cleaning, while the service with CategoryId 2 and ServiceId 4 is furniture assembly)
CategoryId: Anonymized categories. (Example: Cleaning, transportation, renovation category)
CreateDate: The date the service was purchased
